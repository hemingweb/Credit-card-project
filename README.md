# Credit-card-project
go lang credit card validation project

# Project Description
For the class project, I want you to create your own Go application. Don't worry, it's just a small exercise to help you get started writing some Go code. Here are the project specs...

- Have the program take in a 16-digit credit card number from the command line. You might need to do a small bit of online research to figure out how to do this. (Hint: look into the "flag" package).
- Run the Luhn Sum algorithm on this 16-digit credit card number to determine whether or not the number is valid. All valid credit card numbers must pass this check. Here is a link to a short tutorial that will show you how the algorithm works (and it even shows the implementation in Java and C code to give you added help if needed): https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/luhn-algorithm/
- Print out a message to the terminal stating whether or not the credit card number is valid based on the output of the Luhn Sum algorithm.

And that's it! As I said, this is just a short little exercise to help get you going with the Go language. Hope you enjoy!#
